Contributing to VTK
===================

Our project uses GitLab for code review and Buildbot to test proposed
patches before they are merged.  Please check our [VTK Git][]
instructions for details on developing and contributing to the project.

Our [Wiki][] is used to document features, flesh out designs and host other
documentation. Our API is documented using [Doxygen][] with updated
documentation generated nightly. We have several [Mailing Lists][]
to coordinate development and to provide support.
